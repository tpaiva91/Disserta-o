  better and will only in exceptional cases harm normal SGML processing.

* ADDED/MODIFIED: Attributes not in the source, but with a default or

  old behaviour can be used using the defaults(false) option to
  load_structure/3.

* FIXED: sgml utility to canonise space in output of `list' attributes.

* FIXED: Allow <!USEMAP before <!SHORTREF

* FIXED: handling the #empty map (SGML SHORTREF).

* MODIFIED: state-engine for <>, using a new state S_DECL0 after seeing <
  to decide whether this is a non-escaped < in CDATA or a real tag.  Also
  changed comment-handling to avoid the need for parser->previous_char.

* ADDED: sgml utility allow for parsing stdin.

* PERFORMANCE: Improved expand_[p]entities(), providing about 10%
  overall improvement.

* FIXED: crash in sgml (demo-)driver app causing a crash if the input
  file has no extension (Richard O'Keefe).

* ADDED: support for RCDATA declared-content elements

* FIXED: Crash if start of file is not a declaration but ordinary non-blank
  text.

* ADDED: Improved source-location handling and some additional call-backs
  to the call-back interface, preparing the parser for supporting SGML
  syntax highlighting and checking editors.  See get_sgml_parser/2 and
  sgml_parse/2 predicates.

VERSION 1.0.7
=============

* IMPROVED: Redirect all memory management to print a fatal error message
  instead of crashing.

* IMPROVED: Handle the (illegal) comment <!-- some text -- more text -->
  more elegantly: assume <!-- will be terminated by --> and generate a
  warning if text was found outside --comment--.

* FIXED: Some issues in marked-section handling

* ADDED: Direct error reporting of sgml application through callback for
  demo purposes.  Message now includes the current dialect.

* FIXED: sgml application: do not convert case in XML mode.

* FIXED: Do not report error on not-declared xmlns attribute in XML mode.

* Cleaned Makefiles

VERSION 1.0.6
=============

* ADDED: SGML based documentation of the package with converters to LaTeX
  and HTML in Prolog.

  By default NUMBER and NUMBERS tokens are now parsed as tokens of digits.
  Using number(integer) they are converted to Prolog integers, provided
  they fit (Richard O'Keefe).

* ADDED: If a document is parsed without DTD and a catalog is provided,
  try finding a matching DTD file from the catalog.  If successful
  print a warning and load this DTD.

  outer environments, not because an element is encountered that fits in
  an outer environment.  Improves error behaviour.

* ADDED: Print default list values in dtd2pl

* ADDED: Support for the content-model ANY.

* ADDED: option -xml to pl2dtd to force it loading a DTD in XML mode.

* FIXED: Do not expand SHORTREF inside CDATA marked sections and elements.

* FIXED: Open CDATA element when encountering a CDATA entity.

* FIXED: SHORTTAG with attributes: <foo a=b/value/

* FIXED: Allow for quoted nmtoken, etc. in ATTLIST declaration.
  (Andrew Dadakov)

* FIXED: NUMBER attribute declaration with default (skip layout afterwards)

* ADDED: Support for NOTATION attribute

* FIXED: memory allocation/free bug in model-reduction ((a|b)*)

* FIXED: Avoid crash on bad attribute-list

* ADDED: Reporting errors and warnings through print_message/2.

* FIXED: Handling of end-of-file in CDATA
